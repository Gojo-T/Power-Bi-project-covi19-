## Covid ‚Äì 19 Dashboard 

This repository contains a Power BI project designed to provide comprehensive insights into the Covid-19 pandemic. The dashboard presents data visualizations to analyze and understand trends in Covid-19 cases and deaths over time, across locations, and by regions.


You can see this Dashboard through the this Bar-Code, You just need to scane this code from PowerBI Mobile Application. 


## üìä Features
### The dashboard is divided into eight pages, each focusing on specific aspects of the Covid-19 data:

## Overview on Dashboard
### I have added two slicer with Region and Date, allowing users to filter and view data for specific regions and specific times. This feature enhances the chart's functionality, providing clear insigh

Stacked Column Chart: is showing the Number of Covid-19 cases and deaths over time.

Line Chart: Showing Weekly moving average of cases and deaths.

MAP: Showing the Intense places of Covid-19 cases over the world.

Donut Chart: Showing the Country-wise case counts.

Bar Chart: Showing the Most affected locations by the number of cases.

### Trends Over Months and Years

Dual column charts displaying Covid-19 cases and deaths over months and years.

### Extreme Points Analysis
These visualizations provide a detailed analysis of COVID-19 case trends. The two line charts highlight spikes and declines in case numbers over time, allowing for clear tracking of the pandemic's progression. Additionally, two Bar Chart represents the highest and lowest case counts by year

### Weekly Average of Cases & Deaths


These line charts depict the weekly trends of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths. One chart shows the Average of cases over time , while the other shows the Average of Deaths over time . A slicer with a hierarchy of region and country is included, Weekly Moving Average of the Cases 20K Avg. No. of Cases allowing users to filter and view data for specific regions and countries. This feature enhances the chart's functionality, providing clear insighas into the regional and country

### Country-Wise Case Analysis

In this Pie chart displays the count of COVID-19 cases by country. Each segment represents a different country, with the size corresponding to the number of cases. Here is a region-based slicer to enhancing the chart's functionality and providing clearer insights data. Here is also Monthly Filter Each Years.

### Geographical Intensity

This map chart visualizes COVID 19 case intensity using a different colour gradient. Larger shades represent higher case numbers, while smaller shades indicate lower case counts. It's a helpful tool for identifying hotspots and observing the spread of the virus across different regions and countries. I have added here slicer also. You can use it to see the cases of specific region and country.

### Regional Impact

I have created the (Hierarchy of Region & Country) in Data Pane and use the Hierarchy in the above chart to show the Highest Number of cases & Deaths by Region & Country. I already inserted the Zoom Slider in above chart, so you can use it to see the Death Count.

### Time-Based Regional Analysis

Here I have used the Hierarchy that I created in the previous Tab. Using this, I have shown the Most Affected Region through its Maximum Number of Cases. And I have added a Slicer with years & months option, so through this you can see which region is most affected at according the times. And In the header icon you can see the Hierarchy button, you can use it to see most affected Country in every region.
